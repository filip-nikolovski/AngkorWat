            <p>Outer enclosure
The outer wall, 1024 by 802 m and 4.5 m high, is surrounded by a 30 m apron of
open ground and a moat 190 m wide. Access to the temple is by an earth bank to
the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main entrance, is
a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge.[28] There are gopuras at
each of the cardinal points; the western is by far the largest and has three
ruined towers. Glaize notes that this gopura both hides and echoes the form of
the temple proper.[29] Under the southern tower is a statue of Vishnu, known as
Ta Reach, which may originally have occupied the temple's central shrine.[28]
Galleries run between the towers and as far as two further entrances on either
side of the gopura often referred to as "elephant gates", as they are large
enough to admit those animals. These galleries have square pillars on the outer
(west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the
pillars is decorated with lotus rosettes; the west face of the wall with dancing
figures; and the east face of the wall with balustered windows, dancing male
figures on prancing animals, and devatas, including (south of the entrance) the
only one in the temple to be showing her teeth.
The outer wall encloses a space of 820,000 square metres (203 acres), which
besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and, to the north
of the temple, the royal palace. Like all secular buildings of Angkor, these
were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, so nothing remains of
them except the outlines of some of the streets.[30] Most of the area is now
covered by forest. A 350 m causeway connects the western gopura to the temple
proper, with naga balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on
either side. Each side also features a library with entrances at each cardinal
point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between
the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design,
as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the
central structure.[30]</p>
